This project aims at practicing people with memory problems (e.g. elderly people, people on the verge of Alzheimer's disease) through a variety of games. 

There are 15 games that are divided into 4 categories depending on what cognitive skill will be practiced. 

Categories are: 
- memory 
- problem solving
- user attention
- brain processing speed
The app has been implemented for Android Tablets.
