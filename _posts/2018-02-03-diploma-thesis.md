This project aims at practicing people with memory problems (e.g. elderly people, people on the verge of Alzheimer's disease) through a variety of games. 

There was designed and implemented 15 games that are divided into 4 categories depending on what cognitive skills will be practiced. 

Categories are: 
- memory 
- problem solving
- user attention
- brain processing speed

The diploma thesis was held in five stages.

- Research 
- UX Design and technical requirements 
- Implementation 
- Testing 
- Refactor 


Research 

In this stage we did a bibliographic study about serious games and their association with the problem of mild cognitive impairment(MCI).
The purpose of the study was to understand how to design computer games that they can boost and practice cognitive skills.

UX Design and technical requirements 

In this stage  we designed the UX of the application with the help of what we learn of the previous stage .
Also here is the time for the technical requirements and the analyse of the application 


Implementation 

This stage was the implementation of the application. 
The application was implemented for Android platforms with tablet-oriented graphics.
A sqlite database has been used.
Implementation was the most time-consuming stage.

Testing

Now it's time to publish the beta of the application  and give it to real users.
Ten users used  the app and we collected some data!
To collect data from the evaluation we used two methods passive user observation and  questionnaires.

Refactor

Finally, through the results of the evaluation we came up with conclusions to improve the usability of the application.
So, a massive refactor have been done.
We redesigned the UX of the app , the usability and some bugs in the gameplays.
