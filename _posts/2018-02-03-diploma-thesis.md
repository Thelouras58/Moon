There was designed and implemented 15 games that are divided into 4 categories depending on what cognitive skills will be practiced
 
The diploma thesis was held in five stages.

- Research 
- UX Design and technical requirements 
- Implementation 
- Testing 
- Refactor 

### Research 

In this stage, we did a bibliographic study about serious games and their association with the problem of mild cognitive impairment(MCI).
The purpose of the study was to understand how to design computer games that they can boost and practice cognitive skills.

### UX Design and technical requirements 

The users of the app have specific characteristics, so the UX and the usability of the app must be designed carefully. The previous research helped a lot to design a user friendly app.
 
Also  In this stage we did the analysis of the application. Functional and no fuctional requirements,  architecture and structural requirements and design requirements


### Implementation 

The application was implemented for Android platforms with tablet-oriented graphics.
A local SQLite database has been used.

The technologies that have been used are 

Android SDK
- Java
- XML
- SQLite
- Git


### Testing

Now it's time to publish the beta of the application and give it to real users.
Ten users used the app and we collected some data!
To collect data from the evaluation we used two methods passive user observation and questionnaires.

### Refactor

Finally, through the results of the evaluation, we came up with conclusions to improve the usability of the application.
So, a massive refactor has been done.
We redesigned the UX of the app, the usability and some bugs in the gameplays.
