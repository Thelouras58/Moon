This project aims at practicing people with memory problems (e.g. elderly people, people on the verge of Alzheimer's disease) through a variety of games. 

There was designed and implemented 15 games that are divided into 4 categories depending on what cognitive skill will be practiced. 

Categories are: 
- memory 
- problem solving
- user attention
- brain processing speed

The diploma thesis was held in four stages.

Firstly, we did a  bibliographic study about serious games and their association with the problem of mild cognitive impairment(MCI). The purpose of the study was to decide what games will be designed and implemented for this purpose.

In the second stage we designed the games and the technical features of the application.

The third stage was the implementation of the games. The application was implemented for Android platforms with tablet-oriented graphics.

The last step was the evaluation of the app by users to whom the app is addressed. To collect data from the evaluation we used two methods passive user observation and  questionnaires.

Finally, through the results of the evaluation we came up with conclusions to improve the usability of the application.
