## My first Android game

You can read the full report of the project in Greek **[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y8Mw7jFEvIboLpTVxipmXiU-XxDtsov-)**.

In the last lab project of the course "Design and Development of Mobile Applications", we are free to make whatever application we want. In this application, we must use databases, sensors, APIs, etc. 

So we decided to make a game!

The name of the game is Weather Ball.
The player can move a ball and he must avoid obstacles and catch coins.

So, why the name is weather ball?
A nice feature is that the levels can adapt in real-life weather conditions.

Some technologies that we used to develop the app.

For the movement of the ball, we use the rotation matrix from the sensor manager to get the roll.

For the weather feature, we get from Geolocation the coordinates of the phone and send them to OpenWeatherApi. The open weather API returns the weather in this location.

We are using 2 databases. One local SQLite and one remote firebase NoSQL.

For version control we used Github.
Adobe Photoshop and Audacity for the assets 

So, in the end of this journey i learned a lot about Android and mobile app development.

One of the things i learned is that if I want to create Games the right way I must learn Unity !!
