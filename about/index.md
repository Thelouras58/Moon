## Experience

So, i love coding and that i did. During my studies I was enrolled into  courses that were programming affiliated.

From that experience I learned how to create applications with a variety of technologies.

The main technologies that i used are Java, Android, PHP, Python, C++, C, Sqlite, PLsql and more.
